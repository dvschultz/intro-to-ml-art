- Runway also has an official [Slack](https://runwayml.com/joinslack). This can be helpful for debugging technical issues or to see what others are making.

### Homework:
- Please complete the [poll](http://whenisgood.net/p582xzy) for us to find a time for a co-working Q&A session.
- Play with the models in Runway
  - Find a model to explore
  - In the class Slack tell us the following:
    - What model you used
    - What the inputs and outputs were: text, image, etc.
    - What questions you have about the model
    - Show us what you made!
- Think about a bigger project you want to make
  - Look at the Runway Slack and social projects for inspiration ([Runway YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/runwayml))
  - Look at some of the models and consider what inputs you have available to you and what you want as outputs

### Homework:
- **Keep exploring models**
  - We’ve covered a handful of models so far in class, but there are many more! Keep digging around. We’ve created a [playlist of model videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuCzxqIpJs8OOUUePUNVCHrCGDoKTtyn) to watch if you’re interested.
- **Sign up for 1:1 sessions with [Derrick](https://calendly.com/derrick-schultz/1-on-1) or [Lia](https://calendly.com/lialialiacole/30min)**
- **If you’re interested in training...** We won’t cover training in this 3-week course, but we do have videos from other classes that you can watch. Ask us questions!
