- Runway also has an official [Slack](https://runwayml.com/joinslack). This can be helpful for debugging technical issues or to see what others are making.

### Homework:
- Please complete the [poll](http://whenisgood.net/p582xzy) for us to find a time for a co-working Q&A session.
- Play with the models in Runway
  - Find a model to explore
  - In the class Slack tell us the following:
    - What model you used
    - What the inputs and outputs were: text, image, etc.
    - What questions you have about the model
    - Show us what you made!
- Think about a bigger project you want to make
  - Look at the Runway Slack and social projects for inspiration ([Runway YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/runwayml))
  - Look at some of the models and consider what inputs you have available to you and what you want as outputs
